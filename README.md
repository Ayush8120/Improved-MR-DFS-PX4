The algorith has its implementation in [MATLAB](link) but in this repository we focus on python + ROS + Gazebo simulations


[Step 1](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/ros/mavros_installation.html) MAVROS installation
In case you feel stuck with the steps here is a YouTube video to sail you through this step -[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBTikChu02E) 


[Step 2](https://docs.px4.io/master/en/simulation/ros_interface.html) Getting 1 drone in world

---
	cd <PX4-Autopilot_clone>
	DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl_default gazebo
	source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash    # (optional)
	source Tools/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default
	export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd)
	export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd)/Tools/sitl_gazebo
	roslaunch px4 posix_sitl.launch

---
	Clone the PX4-Autopilot Git Repository[link](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot)
		cd Firmware_clone
		git submodule update --init --recursive
		DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl_default gazebo
		source Tools/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default
		export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd):$(pwd)/Tools/sitl_gazebo
		roslaunch px4 multi_uav_mavros_sitl.launch
---

-------------
- Replace empty.world in the Tools/sitl_gazebo/worlds with [this](link to empty.world)
- Add the landing_station model in Tools/sitl_gazebo/models {these are repsonsible for the landing markers}
- replace [these](link to launch folder) launch files with the ones already present in launch folder in PX4 git clone
- make a catkin workspace and add ayush package to it. This contains all code and nodes that need to be run for simulation
-------------

---
	roslaunch px4 multi_uav_macros_sitl.launch
	roslaunch ayush best.launch 
---
This will launch the empty world contatining nodes and a basic implementation of the algorithm










-------------------------
#City Simulation

In ayush package there are 10 nodes corresponding to 10 UAVs used for city simulation.
Other required files for the city simulation are kept in City Simulation folder.
- Add the world files
- Replace the launch file
- Models of Police Station, landing mat and grass plane are kept in the models file. Add them to your models folder at the location PX4-firware-clone/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models

The tree structure's cordinates were calculated using a MATLAB program (link to the MATLAB repository - with the 10 leaf node program)
