# Improved-MR-DFS-PX4
Improved Multi-Robot Depth First Search Algorithm implementation using iris drones using PX4.
Performed on Ubuntu 18.04 - Gazebo 9

The algorith has its implementation in [MATLAB](https://github.com/Ayush8120/MR-DFS) but in this repository we focus on python + ROS + Gazebo simulations

		cd Firmware_clone
		git submodule update --init --recursive
		DONT_RUN=1 make px4_sitl_default gazebo
		source Tools/setup_gazebo.bash $(pwd) $(pwd)/build/px4_sitl_default
		export ROS_PACKAGE_PATH=$ROS_PACKAGE_PATH:$(pwd):$(pwd)/Tools/sitl_gazebo
		roslaunch px4 multi_uav_mavros_sitl.launch

Simulation of our program
----------------------------
- Models of Police Station, landing mat and grass plane are kept in the [models](https://github.com/Ayush8120/Improved-MR-DFS-PX4/tree/main/models) file. Add them to  your models folder at the location PX4-firware-clone/Tools/sitl_gazebo/models
- Add the [world](https://github.com/Ayush8120/Improved-MR-DFS-PX4/tree/main/worlds) files at PX4-firware-clone/Tools/sitl_gazebo/worlds
- replace [these](https://github.com/Ayush8120/Improved-MR-DFS-PX4/tree/main/launch) launch files with the ones already present at PX4-firware-clone/launch
- make a catkin workspace and add [ayush](https://github.com/Ayush8120/Improved-MR-DFS-PX4/tree/main/ayush) package to it. This contains all code and nodes that need to be run for simulation
-------------

---
	roslaunch px4 multi_uav_macros_sitl.launch
	roslaunch ayush city.launch 
---
This will launch the empty world contatining grass plane, Police Station, Landing Mat and 10 Iris Drones.

-------------------------
Description of The World & Simulation Specifices
----------------------------
In ayush package there are 10 nodes corresponding to 10 UAVs used for city simulation. 
- 10 iris drones take off from the roof of the station
- Go at the leaf nodes and wait for further command 
- As soon as they are given command they start exploration
- Upon finishing the exploration they return back to the base station
  
Results for the city simulation are kept in [City Simulation Results](https://github.com/Ayush8120/Improved-MR-DFS-PX4/tree/main/City%20Simulation%20Results) folder.


If you wish to play around with the dimensions/color of the drone then you can edit them at PX4-firmware-clone/Tools/sutl_gazebo/models/iris/iris.sdf.jinja

---------------
The MATLAB Simulation
----------------
- When you run the uav_city nodes the animation for the path travelled by each drone as well as the scatter plot of the path is generated by MATPLOTLIB (check ~/.ros)
![All 10 Path Scatter Plot ](https://github.com/Ayush8120/Improved-MR-DFS-PX4/blob/main/City%20Simulation%20Results/All-10-routes/All_10_route.png)
- Apart from this, You can run the finalanimation.m in MATLAB. This gives an animation of this sort

--------------------


The tree structure's cordinates were calculated using a MATLAB program (link to the MATLAB repository - with the 10 leaf node program)
